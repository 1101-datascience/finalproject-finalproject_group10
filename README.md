### Goal
The goal of our project is to predict the loyalty of customers towards the payment company Elo, one of the largest payment brands in Brazil. The company has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders, and this data science project will help them to assess their business model and know more about the customers' experience.

### Demo 
You should provide an example commend to reproduce your result
```R
Rscript modeling.R --train train_0109_tg.csv --test test_0106.csv --report performance.csv --predict predict.csv
```

### data

* Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation
* Input format: Dataset Training Data 201917 Customers x 84 (83 features + 1 target + 1 exp(target)). Testing Data 123623 x 83 features.
* There are four datasets. One for customer profile, one for past transaction records, one for new transaction records and one for merchant details.
* We first clean the merchant details. the main issue here include duplicated merchants with different properties, missing values in some of the merchant features. Next, we process transaction records by grouping up data from the same card_id and examine there mean, variance and more. Lastly, we try to construct some new features that measures the ratio or the difference between transaction behaviors in two time period.
* Most of the missing values are imputed by either mode, mean or median based on the exploratory data analysis.
* Since the processed data is too big, we will upload it through cloud: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11UEHfoTjIopv38MvSmCNH7UICLZi84tn?usp=sharing


### code

* Which method do you use?
  * random forest
* What is a null model for comparison?
  * kaggle提供的kaggle值為3.87852
* How do your perform evaluation? ie. cross-validation, or addtional indepedent data set
  * 82分為train、test
  * 建五個model，去掉最大和最小的預測值，以剩下三個預測數的平均，作為最終的預測值

### results

* Which metric do you use 
  * MSE、RMSE、R-square
* Is your improvement significant?
  * no,R-Squared通常以0.01成長
* What is the challenge part of your project?
  * 原始資料的數值和類別是匿名的，難以判斷分析
  * 原始資料龐大且分散，需要多層處理。主表上只有3個特徵，最後我們共造出84個特徵
  * 檔案很大，導致部署到ShinyIO或prepocessing、modeling時，會因為out of memory無法正常運作。
